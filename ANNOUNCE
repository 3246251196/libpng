Changes since the last public release (1.5.18):

Version 1.5.19beta01 [February 26, 2014]
  Moved redefines of png_error(), png_warning(), png_chunk_error(),
    and png_chunk_warning() from pngpriv.h to png.h to make them visible
    to libpng-calling applications.
  Fixed typos in the manual and in scripts/pnglibconf.dfa (CFLAGS -> CPPFLAGS
    and PNG_USR_CONFIG -> PNG_USER_CONFIG).

Version 1.5.19beta02 [March 17, 2014]
  Use "if (value != 0)" instead of "if (value)" consistently.
  Moved configuration information from the manual to the INSTALL file.

Version 1.5.19beta03 [March 22, 2014]
  Removed #if/#else/#endif from inside two pow() calls in pngvalid.c because
    they were handled improperly by Portland Group's PGI-14.1 - PGI-14.3
    when using its "__builtin_pow()" function.
  Silence 'unused parameter' build warnings (Cosmin).
  $(CP) is now used alongside $(RM_F).  Also, use 'copy' instead
    of 'cp' where applicable, and applied other minor makefile changes.
  Don't warn about invalid dimensions exceeding user limits.
  Allow an easy replacement of the default pre-built configuration
    header with a custom header, via the make PNGLIBCONF_H_PREBUILT
    macro.
