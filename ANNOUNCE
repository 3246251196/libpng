Changes since the last public release (1.4.0beta107):

version 1.4.1alpha01 [November 27, 2009]
  Based on 1.4.0beta107 (prerelease)

version 1.4.1alpha02 [December 11, 2009]
  Restored premultiplied alpha feature from version 1.4.0beta105.
  Added "double gamma" to parameters for png_set_premultiply_alpha().
  Added "float postmultiply_gamma" member to the png_struct.
  Moved PNG_DIVIDE_BY_255, PNG_8_BIT_PREMULTIPLY(), etc., from
    png.h to pngpriv.h
  Updated documentation about png_set_premultiply_alpha().
  Always expand pixels to 16-bit samples when premultiplying.
  In pngconf.h, require PNG_GAMMA_SUPPORTED to be defined when defining
    PNG_READ_PREMULTIPLY_ALPHA_SUPPORTED
  Eliminated PNG_DIVIDE_BY_255 and PNG_8_BIT_PREMULTIPLY macros
    leaving only PNG_DIVIDE_BY_65535 and PNG_16_BIT_PREMULTIPLY
    because we will always work with 16 bits.
  Sync with version 1.4.0beta107:
    Updated README
    Added "#define PNG_NO_PEDANTIC_WARNINGS" in the libpng source files.
    Removed "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" from the makefiles, projects, and contrib.
    Revised scripts/makefile.netbsd, makefile.openbsd, and makefile.sco
      to put png.h and pngconf.h in $prefix/include, like the other scripts,
      instead of in $prefix/include/libpng.  Also revised makefile.sco
      to put them in $prefix/include/libpng15 instead of in
      $prefix/include/libpng/libpng15.
  Relocated png_do_chop() to its original position in pngrtran.c; the
    change in version 1.2.41beta08 caused transparency to be handled wrong
    in some 16-bit datastreams (Yusaku Sugai).

version 1.5.0alpha01 [January 4, 2010]
  Bump version to 1.5.0alpha01
  Add "depth" parameter to private png_build_gamma_table()
  Declared png_cleanup_needed "volatile" in pngread.c and pngwrite.c
  Renamed libpng-pc.in back to libpng.pc.in and revised CMakeLists.txt
    (revising the change in 1.4.0beta99)
  Swapped PNG_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED and PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED
    in pngset.c to be consistent with other changes in version 1.2.38.
  Changed "libpng-pc.in" to "libpng.pc.in" in configure.ac, configure, and
    Makefile.in to be consistent with changes in libpng-1.4.0rc03
  Avoid deprecated references to png_ptr-io_ptr and png_ptr->error_ptr
    in pngtest.c
  Recognize and use "--sysroot=DIR" in libpng-config.in and libpng.pc.in
  Recognize and use environment variable $PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR as default
    setting of ${sysroot} in libpng.pc.in
  Removed the just-added sysroot feature.  It is the job of pkg-config,
    not foo.pc, to mangle the directory locations when $PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR
    has been defined.
  Revised Makefile.am and makefile.in to remove references to Y2KINFO,
    KNOWNBUG, and libpng.la (Robert Schwebel)
