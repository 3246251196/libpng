Changes since the last public release (1.5.21):

Version 1.5.22beta01 [January 29, 2015]
  Regenerated configure scripts with libtool-2.4.4
  Made the check for out-of-range values in png_set_tRNS() detect
    values that are exactly 2^bit_depth, and work on 16-bit platforms.
  Quieted some warnings from Coverity-scan.

Version 1.5.22beta02 [February 17, 2015]
  Merged pngtest.c with libpng-1.6.17/pngtest.c
  Display user limits in the output from pngtest.
  Eliminated the PNG_SAFE_LIMITS macro and restored the 1-million-column
    and 1-million-row default limits in pnglibconf.dfa, that can be reset
    by the user at build time or run time.  This provides a more robust
    defense against DOS and as-yet undiscovered overflows.
