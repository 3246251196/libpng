Changes since the last public release (1.5.19):

Version 1.5.20beta01 [November 6, 2014]
  Removed "option WRITE_COMPRESSED_TEXT enables WRITE_TEXT" from pnglibconf.dfa
  Only mark text chunks as written after successfully writing them.
  Avoid out-of-bounds memory access in png_user_version_check().
  Simplified and future-proofed png_user_version_check().

Version 1.5.20beta02 [November 10, 2014]
  Quieted three "comparison is always false due to limited range" compiler
    warnings in pngset.c

Version 1.5.20rc01 [November 13, 2014]

Version 1.5.20rc02 [November 14, 2014]
  The macros passed in the command line to Borland make are ignored if
    similarly-named macros are already defined in makefiles. This behavior
    is different from POSIX make and other make programs.  Surround the
    macro definitions with ifndef guards (Cosmin).
  Use memcpy instead of CopyMemory in the definition of png_memcpy.
    The Borland C++ build breaks otherwise (Cosmin).
