Changes since the last public release (1.4.20):

version 1.4.22beta01 [August 28. 2017]
  Added PNGMINUS_UNUSED macro to contrib/pngminus/p*.c and added missing
    parenthesis in contrib/pngminus/pnm2png.c (bug report by Christian Hesse).

version 1.4.22beta02 [September 14, 2017]
  Compute a larger limit on IDAT because some applications write a deflate
    buffer for each row (Bug report by Andrew Church).
  Fixed incorrect typecast of some arguments to png_malloc() and
    png_calloc() that were png_uint_32 instead of png_alloc_size_t
    (Bug report by "irwir" in Github libpng issue #175).

version 1.4.22beta03 [September 20, 2017]
  Initialize memory allocated by png_inflate to zero, using memset, to
    stop an oss-fuzz "use of uninitialized value" detection in png_set_text_2()
    due to truncated iTXT or zTXT chunk.
