Changes since the last public release (1.4.0beta107):

version 1.4.1alpha01 [November 27, 2009]
  Based on 1.4.0beta107 (prerelease)

version 1.4.1alpha02 [December 11, 2009]
  Restored premultiplied alpha feature from version 1.4.0beta105.
  Added "double gamma" to parameters for png_set_premultiply_alpha().
  Added "float postmultiply_gamma" member to the png_struct.
  Moved PNG_DIVIDE_BY_255, PNG_8_BIT_PREMULTIPLY(), etc., from
    png.h to pngpriv.h
  Updated documentation about png_set_premultiply_alpha().
  Always expand pixels to 16-bit samples when premultiplying.
  In pngconf.h, require PNG_GAMMA_SUPPORTED to be defined when defining
    PNG_READ_PREMULTIPLY_ALPHA_SUPPORTED
  Eliminated PNG_DIVIDE_BY_255 and PNG_8_BIT_PREMULTIPLY macros
    leaving only PNG_DIVIDE_BY_65535 and PNG_16_BIT_PREMULTIPLY
    because we will always work with 16 bits.
  Sync with version 1.4.0beta107:
    Updated README
    Added "#define PNG_NO_PEDANTIC_WARNINGS" in the libpng source files.
    Removed "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" from the makefiles, projects, and contrib.
    Revised scripts/makefile.netbsd, makefile.openbsd, and makefile.sco
      to put png.h and pngconf.h in $prefix/include, like the other scripts,
      instead of in $prefix/include/libpng.  Also revised makefile.sco
      to put them in $prefix/include/libpng14 instead of in
      $prefix/include/libpng/libpng14.
  Relocated png_do_chop() to its original position in pngrtran.c; the
    change in version 1.2.41beta08 caused transparency to be handled wrong
    in some 16-bit datastreams (Yusaku Sugai).

version 1.5.0alpha01 [December 22, 2009]
  Bump version to 1.5.0alpha01
  Add "depth" parameter to private png_build_gamma_table()
  Declared png_cleanup_needed "volatile" in pngread.c and pngwrite.c
  Renamed libpng-pc.in back to libpng.pc.in and revised CMakeLists.txt
    (revising the change in 1.4.0beta99)
