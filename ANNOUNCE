Changes since the last public release (1.0.18):

version 1.0.19 [June 26, 2006]
  Sync with versions libpng-1.2.9 and 1.2.10
  Increased sprintf buffer from 50 to 52 chars in pngrutil.c to avoid
    buffer overflow.
  Fixed bug in example.c (png_set_palette_rgb -> png_set_palette_to_rgb)
  Prepended "#! /bin/sh" to ltmail.sh and contrib/pngminus/*.sh (Cosmin).
  Avoided potential buffer overflow and optimized buffer in
    png_write_sCAL(), png_write_sCAL_s() (Cosmin).
  Removed the include directories and libraries from CFLAGS and LDFLAGS
    in scripts/makefile.gcc (Nelson A. de Oliveira, Cosmin).
  Allow zero-length IDAT chunks after the entire zlib datastream, but not
    after another intervening chunk type.
  Added prototypes for PNG_INCH_CONVERSIONS functions to png.h
  Revised INSTALL and autogen.sh
  Fixed typo in several makefiles (-W1 should be -Wl)
  Added one zero element to png_gamma_shift[] array in pngrtran.c to avoid
    reading out of bounds.
