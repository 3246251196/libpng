Changes since the last public release (1.4.16):

version 1.4.17beta01 [August 19, 2015]
  Fix typecast in a png_debug2() statement in png_set_text_2() to
    avoid a compiler warning in PNG_DEBUG builds.
  Avoid Coverity issues 80855, 80856, and 80857 (PRINTF_ARG_MISMATCH)
    in pngtest.c PNG_DEBUG builds.
  Avoid Coverity issue 80858 (REVERSE NULL) in pngtest.c PNG_DEBUG builds.
  Removed WRITE_WEIGHTED_FILTERED code.
  Added -DZ_SOLO to contrib/pngminim/*/makefile to work with zlib-1.2.7+
  Use nanosleep() instead of usleep() in contrib/gregbook/rpng2-x.c
    because usleep() is deprecated (port from libpng16).
  Fixed potential leak of png_pixels in contrib/pngminus/pnm2png.c
  Fixed uninitialized variable in contrib/gregbook/rpng2-x.c
  Fixed some bad links in the man page.
  Safely convert num_bytes to a png_byte in png_set_sig_bytes() (Robert
    Seacord).
  Fixed the recently reported 1's complement security issue by replacing
    the value that is illegal in the PNG spec, in both signed and unsigned
    values, with 0. Illegal unsigned values (anything greater than or equal
    to  0x80000000) can still pass through, but since these are not illegal
    in ANSI-C (unlike 0x80000000 in the signed case) the checking that
    occurs later can catch them (John Bowler).

version 1.4.17beta02 [October 15, 2015]
  Fixed png_save_int_32 when int is not 2's complement (John Bowler).
  Added sPLT support to pngtest.c

version 1.4.17beta03 [October 23, 2015]
  Added a safety check in png_set_tIME() (Fixes CVE-2015-7981, bug report
    from Qixue Xiao).

version 1.4.17rc01 [October 31, 2015]
  No changes.
