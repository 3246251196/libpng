Changes since the last public release (1.4.20):
  Moved chunk-name and chunk-length checks into PNG_EXTERN private
    png_check_chunk_name() and png_check_chunk_length() functions
    (Suggested by Max Stepin).
  Check for 0 return from png_get_rowbytes() in contrib/pngminus/*.c to stop
    some Coverity issues (162705, 162706, and 162707).
