Changes since the last public release (1.4.0):

version 1.4.1alpha02 [December 11, 2009]
  Restored premultiplied alpha feature from version 1.4.0beta105.
  Added "double gamma" to parameters for png_set_premultiply_alpha().
  Added "float postmultiply_gamma" member to the png_struct.
  Moved PNG_DIVIDE_BY_255, PNG_8_BIT_PREMULTIPLY(), etc., from

version 1.5.0alpha01 [January 4, 2010]
  Bump version to 1.5.0alpha01
  Add "depth" parameter to private png_build_gamma_table()
  Declared png_cleanup_needed "volatile" in pngread.c and pngwrite.c
  Renamed libpng-pc.in back to libpng.pc.in and revised CMakeLists.txt
    (revising the change in 1.4.0beta99)
  Swapped PNG_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED and PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED
    in pngset.c to be consistent with other changes in version 1.2.38.
  Changed "libpng-pc.in" to "libpng.pc.in" in configure.ac, configure, and
    Makefile.in to be consistent with changes in libpng-1.4.0rc03
  Avoid deprecated references to png_ptr-io_ptr and png_ptr->error_ptr
    in pngtest.c
  Recognize and use "--sysroot=DIR" in libpng-config.in and libpng.pc.in
  Recognize and use environment variable $PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR as default
    setting of ${sysroot} in libpng.pc.in
  Removed the just-added sysroot feature.  It is the job of pkg-config,
    not foo.pc, to mangle the directory locations when $PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR
    has been defined.
  Updated CMakeLists.txt for consistent indentation and to avoid an
    unclosed if-statement warning (Philip Lowman).
  Revised Makefile.am and makefile.in to remove references to Y2KINFO,
    KNOWNBUG, and libpng.la (Robert Schwebel)
