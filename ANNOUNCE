Changes since the last public release (1.4.9):

  Removed two useless #ifdef directives from pngread.c and one from pngrutil.c
  Eliminated redundant png_push_read_tEXt|zTXt|iTXt|unknown code from
    pngpread.c and use the sequential png_handle_tEXt, etc., in pngrutil.c;
    now that png_ptr->buffer is inaccessible to applications, the special
    handling is no longer useful.
  Fixed bug with png_handle_hIST with odd chunk length (Frank Busse).
  Fixed incorrect type (int copy should be png_size_t copy) in png_inflate().
  Fixed off-by-one bug in png_handle_sCAL() when using fixed point arithmetic,
    causing out-of-bounds read in png_set_sCAL() because of failure to copy
    the string terminators.  This bug was introduced in libpng-1.0.6 (Frank
    Busse).
  Removed the png_free() of unused png_ptr->current_text from pngread.c.
  Fixed PNG_LIBPNG_BUILD_BASE_TYPE definition in png.h
