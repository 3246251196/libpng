Changes since the last public release (1.5.22):

Version 1.5.23beta01 [May 21, 2015]
  Removed unused PNG_SET_CHUNK_[CACHE|MALLOC]_LIMIT_SUPPORTED definitions
    from pnglibconf.h.prebuilt (Andrew Church).
  Replaced "unexpected" with an integer in pngset.c where a long was
    expected, to avoid a compiler warning when PNG_DEBUG > 1.
  Fix typecast in a png_debug2() statement in png_set_text_2() to
    avoid a compiler warning in PNG_DEBUG builds.
  Avoid Coverity issue 80858 (REVERSE NULL) in pngtest.c PNG_DEBUG builds.
  Avoid a harmless potential integer overflow in png_XYZ_from_xy() (Bug
    report from Christopher Ferris).

Version 1.5.23beta02 [June 3, 2015]
  Removed WRITE_WEIGHTED_FILTERED code, to save a few kbytes of the
    compiled library size. It never worked properly and as far as we can
    tell, no one uses it. The png_set_filter_heuristics() and
    png_set_filter_heuristics_fixed() APIs are retained but deprecated
    and do nothing.
  Quieted Coverity issues in pngvalid.c.
  Removed non-working progressive reader 'skip' function.
