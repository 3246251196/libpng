Changes since the last public release (1.5.17):

Version 1.5.18beta01 [August 21, 2013]
  Delay calling png_init_filter_functions() until a row with nonzero filter
    is found.

Version 1.5.18beta02 [December 26, 2013]
  Changed tabs to 3 spaces in png_debug macros and changed '"%s"m'
    to '"%s" m' to improve portability among compilers.
  Added "-Wall" to CFLAGS in contrib/pngminim/*/makefile
  Conditionally compile some unused functions reported by -Wall in
    pngminim.
  Rebuilt configure scripts with automake-1.14.1 and autoconf-2.69
    in the tar distributions.

Version 1.5.18beta03 [December 27, 2013]
  Fixed 'unused' warnings and mergeed with libpng16 pngvalid.
    Various warnings revealed by configurations added to the tested
    configurations in libpng 1.6 need corresponding fixes in libpng 1.5.
    This takes the libpng 1.6 pngvalid.c and adds it back to libpng 1.5,
    however one write-only test is currently disabled because it does not
    work; possibly because of failures to reset or initialize the deflate
    stream correctly in write-only cases.
