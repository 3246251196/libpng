Changes since the last public release (1.6.0):

Version 1.7.0alpha01 [December 15, 2012]
  Started 1.7.0 branch from libpng-1.6.0beta33.
  Made 8-bit compose and rgb_to_grayscale accuracy improvements.  These
    changes cause 16-bit arithmetic to be used for 8-bit data in the gamma
    corrected compose and grayscale operations.  The arithmetic errors have
    three sources all of which are fixed in this commit:
    1) 8-bit linear calculations produce massive errors for lower intensity
       values.
    2) The old 16-bit "16 to 8" gamma table code erroneously wrote the lowest
       output value into a table entry which corresponded to multiple output
       values (so where the value written should have been the closest to the
       transformed input value.)
    3) In a number of cases the code to access the 16-bit table did not round;
       it did a simple shift, which was wrong and made the side effects of (2)
       even worse.
  The new gamma code does not have the 16-to-8 problem at the cost of slighly
    more calculations and the algorithm used to minimize the number of
    calculations has been extended to all the 16-bit tables; it has advantages
    for any significant gamma correction.
  Rearranged png_struct, remove unused members, change png_set_filter handling
    png_struct members rearranged - partly to reorder to avoid packing, partly
    to put frequently accessed members at the start and partly to make
    the grouping more clear. png_set_filter code has been rewritten and the
    code shared with png_write_start_row moved to a common function.  Comments
    in png.h have been made more clear. Minor fixes to
    contrib/libtests/timepng.c and some of the png_*_tRNS logic, including
    more error detection in png_set_tRNS.
  Clean up USER_LIMITS feature, removing members from png_struct when not
    required.
