There's no makefile or "configure" for pngcrush.

All you should need to do is enter the pngcrush-1.2.l
directory and type

    cc -O -o pngcrush *.c -lm
    cp pngcrush /usr/local/bin  # or wherever you want

You might want to create a makefile if you are planning to do
something more complicated, like loading with your own shared
libraries for libpng and zlib.

Here's the command for compiling on SGI IRIX:

    cc -n32 -fullwarn -O2 -IPA:plimit=256 -OPT:Olimit=0 -o pngcrush *.c -lm
    cp pngcrush /usr/local/bin

On a PC with DJGCC, you can type

    gcc -O3 -Wall -funroll-loops -o pngcrush *.c
    copy /B pmodstub.exe + pngcrush pngcrush.exe
    then put pngcrush.exe wherever you want.
