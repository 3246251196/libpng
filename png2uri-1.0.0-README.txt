 png2uri is a command-line application that creates an HTML "img" tag on
 standard output containing a data URI, from a PNG file or from standard
 input.

 Usage: png2uri [file]

 Requires /bin/sh and a uuencode(1) that takes the "-m" option to mean
 to encode in base64.  A surprising number of machines that I've tried
 (3 out of 8) don't have uuencode installed.

 If you prefer a web-based converter or a java application, this isn't
 it. Use your search engine and look for "png data uri" to find one.

 To do: test on various platforms. The following have been tried

 This script can be trivially modified to support another image format
 (e.g., change PNG to JPG and "image/png" to "image/jpeg" throughout).

 To do: do that, via a "-f/--format jpg|jpeg|png|bmp|gif" option and by
 inspecting the filename extension.

 If you only want the data uri and not the surrounding "< img src= .. >"
 simply use your text editor to get rid of it.

 To do: do that via a -u/--uri-only option.

 To do: find out if the script works on Windows and Mac or can be modified to
 do so.

 To do: make it work as a drag-and-drop application.

 To do: But keep it simple!
